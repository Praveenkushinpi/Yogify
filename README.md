## 🌟 Why Yogify?

In the rush of modern life, health often becomes a forgotten priority.

We try to get better — we watch a few yoga videos, install random apps, and set ambitious goals. But with so much information and no clear path, we quickly feel overwhelmed and give up.

**Yogify is here to help you start small, stay mindful, and grow consistently.**  
It’s not just about yoga poses — it’s about building a gentle, balanced lifestyle that actually sticks.
